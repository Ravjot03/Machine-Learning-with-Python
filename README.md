  - ### Supervised Learning with Classification Model:
    * [Classification Introduction](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Machine-Learning-Models/blob/master/Classification/ClassificationIntro.ipynb):
      This jupyter notebook contains basics of classification, different types of classification models and their implementation.
    * [Classification Models](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Machine-Learning-Models/blob/master/Classification/ClassificationDataCampModels.ipynb):
      First part of this jupyter notebook contains KNearest Neighbors Classifier Model with different model selectioon like train_test_split and cross validation model.

      Second part of this notebook contains "Fine Tuning of the Model" i.e. how to get Classification Report and Confusion Matrix.
      Second part also contains the Hyperparameters like GridSearchCV , RandomizedSearchCV, Ridge Model and How to deal with missing values.

      Third part contains the Preprocesssing and Pipeline of the data.

      Last part of the jupyter notebook contains basics of another classification model named Support Vector Machines (SVM).
      
    * [Classification Algorithms Project - Diabetes Prediction Project](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Diabetes-Prediction):
      This project consists of different classifiers to predict the whether the person is **diabetic or not**. And different classifers are evaluated by their accuracy scores.
    
    * **Classification Algorithms:**
      
      - [KNearest Neighbors](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Machine-Learning-Models/blob/master/Classification/ClassificationDataCampModels.ipynb):
        K Nearest Neighbours is the simplest of all machine learning algorithms. In this project, I build a kNN classifier to classify the patients suffering from **Diabetes**. I have used the Diabetes Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
      
      - [XGBoost Algorithm Introduction](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Machine-Learning-Models/blob/master/Classification/XGBoost.ipynb):
        This jupyter notebook contains introduction of XGBoost Model.
      - [XGBoost Algorithm Project](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Parkinsons-Disease):
        I have trained a full XGBoosting classifier for **Parkinson’s disease**.
        
      - [Logistic Regression Project](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Heart-Disease-Prediction):
        In this project, I train a binary Logistic Regression classifier to predict whether the person will have any heart disease or not. The dataset is publically available on the Kaggle website, and it is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has **10-years risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD)**. The dataset provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
        
      - [Support Vector Machines Project](https://github.com/Ravjot03/Support-Vector-Machines-Project):
        In this project, I build a Support Vector Machines classifier to classify a **Pulsar star**. I have used the predicting a Pulsar Star dataset for this project. I have downloaded this dataset from the Kaggle website.
